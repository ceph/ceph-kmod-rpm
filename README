This repository used to contain 3rd-party Ceph kernel module packages for RHEL
7.0.

As of RHEL 7.1, libceph.ko and rbd.ko are now included in Red Hat's kernel
packages natively. The RHEL 7.1 kernel packages are more stable and secure than
using these 3rd-party kmods with RHEL 7.0. Please update your systems to RHEL
7.1 or later if you want to use the kernel RBD client.

The CephFS kernel client is undergoing rapid development upstream, and we do
not recommend running the CephFS kernel module on RHEL 7's 3.10 kernel at this
time. Please use ELRepo's latest upstream 4.x kernels if you want to run CephFS
on RHEL 7.
