This repository contains the RPM packaging for building CephFS as a
kabi-tracking kmod for RHEL 7.

The repository follows the standard layout common to a regular package in the
Fedora Linux distribution. The package uses a customized kmodtool script,
modeled after the kmod packages in the ELRepo add-on repository.

There are some notable differences between this package and a "standard"
package you might find in the Fedora Linux distribution:

* This Git branch is labeled "master", but the package is not intended for
  Fedora Rawhide. The package is only for RHEL 7 for now.

* In a typical Fedora package, the Source0 tarball would be stored in a
  lookaside cache in the build infrastructure. With this ceph-kmod package, the
  source tarball is not stored anywhere. Instead, you can generate a tarball on
  the fly using the "generate tarball" script.

* There is a "jenkins/build" script. This script runs inside a Jenkins
  job that builds the entire tarball, source RPM, and binary RPM in mock.

* Instead of a standard ceph-kmod.spec, there is a "ceph-kmod.spec.in" file.
  The jenkins/build script will generate the regular .spec file dynamically,
  filling in the appropriate templated values to match the values from Git.
