This repository contains the RPM packaging for building CephFS as a
kabi-tracking kmod for RHEL 7.

The 30 second synopsis:

  git clone git://... ceph-kmod
  cd ceph-kmod
  ./configure
  make

Note that the make command uses "mock" under the hood, so you should run this
as an unprivileged user and add your UID to the "mock" group. You will also
need a mock configuration for EPEL 7  until the EPEL project itself ships a
valid mock configuration for EPEL 7. See the "doc" subdirectory for more
information about this.

The repository follows the standard layout common to a regular package in the
Fedora Linux distribution. The package uses a customized kmodtool script,
modeled after the kmod packages in the ELRepo add-on repository.

There are some notable differences between this package and a "standard"
package you might find in the Fedora Linux distribution:

* This Git branch is labeled "master", but the package is not intended for
  Fedora Rawhide. The package is only for RHEL 7 for now.

* In a typical Fedora package, you would edit the version numbers in the
  package by hand, and then run "fedpkg", perhaps with additional arguments. To
  abstract this away and make it easier to automate for continuous integration,
  you will find a configure script and Makefile. Just run "./configure && make"
  to go through the process of building the entire binary RPMs.

* After you run ./configure, you will have a Makefile. A Jenkins job runs
  "./configure && make" in order to build the entire tarball, source RPM, and
  binary RPM in mock.

* In a typical Fedora package, the Source0 tarball would be stored in a
  lookaside cache in the build infrastructure. With this ceph-kmod package,
  the source tarball is not stored anywhere. Instead, you can generate a
  tarball on the fly using the "make tarball" command. (This is a dependency
  for the "make all"... or "make rpm"... or even just "make". So if you're
  running any of those, you don't need to run "make tarball" beforehand.)

* Instead of a standard ceph-kmod.spec, there is a "ceph-kmod.spec.in"
  file. The ./configure script will generate the regular .spec file
  dynamically, filling in the appropriate templated values to match the values
  from Git.
